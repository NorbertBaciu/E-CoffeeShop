# E-CoffeeShop
This E-Coffee Shop is used to order Coffees from the list of beverages.
You can Log in , Search the type of coffees in the catalog , add to my Cart , Select Quanty and even introduce ordering details and a basic payment method to pay by card.
I used Spring Boot for Overall Application (Web Application) , HTML/CSS and a bit of Js for the designing of Frontend , Spring Security for the whole Login Process , 
MySql as a database , Spring Data JPA and Hibernate for Mapping and Communicating between the Application and the Database  , 
 and Thymeleaf as a Template Engine for Java Applications.
